# Assignment 1

In this assignment, I use the LL84 and PLUTO data to predict building energy consumption, based on their number of units. After appropriate data pre-processing, I merge the two datasets to get all the variables needed to buld the models in place. After training both a linear and a 2nd degree polynomial model, the likelihood ratio reveals that the polynomial model fits the data better. 

As far as the extra credit is concerned, I plot the log likelihood surface for a range of intercepts and slopes, and visually confirm that the coefficients obtained from the linear regression models minimize the error. Additionally, I present a plot showing how building energy inensity is changing based on building age, area and number of floors.

**Contribution:** I discussed the implementation of the chi-square and likelihood ratio tests with Felipe Gonzalez (fdg224). Also, Felipe helped my debug my code for the first part of the extra credit assignment.

# Assignment 2

In this assignment, I finish the citibike mini-project from previous assignment. Test the hypothesis that younger people commute by bike more often than older. Detailed description of the analysis can be found in the following link:
