In this notebook I query Carto to get grouped asthma related hospital dismissals per NYC zipcode. I merge the data with each zipcode's 
centroid and plot the spatial distribution of asthma dismissals. 

Following, I try to produce the semivariogram of asthma related dismissals. I observe high spatial correlation and some irregular patterns,
probably due to inproper implementation.
