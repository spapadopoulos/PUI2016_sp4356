### Assignment 1

In the first part I use CUSP's coordinates to identify its census track and visualize the result in NYC map.


### Assignment 2

I get 20 years data of business establishments from 1994 to 2013. Properly transform the data into time series and associate 
them with NYC zip codes. I am using two different clustering algorithms, namely KMeans (partitioning) and Agglomerative clustering (hierarchical), to cluster the
time series based on their temporal evolution. Two clusters are identified based on Silhouette score and Elbow method. Then, I 
visualize the clustering results on NYC map and see that New York business establishments increase over time in most zip codes. Some of
the zip codes located in lower Manhattan show decreasing trend. This could be attributed to the fact that lower Manhattan is a well established
commercial area, with not much room for such steep economic development.
